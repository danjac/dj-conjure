# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest `main` branch is supported. We do not provide security updates for older versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in pretalx, please contact [{{ cookiecutter.email }}](mailto:{{ cookiecutter.email }}). We will
respond in a timely manner. If appropriate, we will work with you on further processes/publishing and mitigation.
    Since we are a small open source project, we will not be able to pay bounties, but we will acknowledge you in the
disclosure publication.
